#   input: fileName
#   transform: read contents of fileName
#   output: array of student information studentInfo


# function input user constraints (groups, groupsize, number of charts)
#   input: number of groups, group size, number of charts, F/M/R orientation
#   transform: store inputs as system variables
#   output: array user constraints

# function generate chart
#   input: number of groups, group size, studentInfo
#   transform: allocate all students into evenly populated groups
#   output: seating chart matrix

# function score chart
#   input: seating matrix, student info
#   transform: compare matrix to student info
#   output: score for specific chart

# function find distance between two charts
#   input: matrix 1, matrix 2
#   transform: compare distance between groups (frob. norm? euclidean distance?)
#   output: distance between 1 and 2
